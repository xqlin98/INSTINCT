Splendid landscapes, incredible architecture but in a more than sorry state of preservation.

In the good old days when it was supported by the Soviet Union, the living standard was not bad and they didn't have to rely on income from tourism. Then it all went down the drain, even famine and food rationing have become their daily thing. Since early 00s most not rationed goods are available only for CUC, their convertible currency. The bottom line being that whatever you buy as a tourist, you pay +/- western prices.\r\nDennis: So how much do you two spend daily?\r\nLaura: Staying in private houses about at least 100\u20ac, including food, transport and entrance fees. These days we are compelled to stay at a state-run Hotel and pay thru the nose - 130\u20ac a night. No, Cuba is not cheap. But Havana Club YES.\r\nDennis: Don't like the stuff at all.\r\nLaura: Me neither. Gives me headaches. Even one glass of it.\r\nDennis: What you say will make me think twice before setting sail for Cuba.\r\nLaura: But it can be fantastic as well. Eg Vinales Valley in the west, with its horse-riding trips, wild camping and pure nature.\r\nDennis: Sounds better. I'll ask you for details.\r\nDennis: Anyway enjoy your trip as much as you can.

A considerable improvement\r\nAlex: Man, what's happening to you, you're jokes aren't even funny anymore\r\nMatt: There you go, the aftereffects of 3D\r\nAlex: So what are you actually doing?\r\nMatt: Well actually/to be fair/quite frankly unpaid job number 5 is not that bad at all. I'm working for this association which organises a few events during the year and I'm the Secretary, which looks cool on the cv. And has made me learn what twitter actually is.

And What are you promoting atm?\r\nMatt: I'm going to casually mention that we're having an event at the British Library and that's what I'm promoting\r\nAlex: wow sounds really good\r\nMatt: Yer, good opportunity for networking and I work with really nice people too\r\nAlex: That's cool\r\nMatt: I think it could hardly be better actually. It's also true that these professional British people can sometimes be extremely unprofessional, but this might be the most entertaining part of the job to be fair. The other day, for instance, my colleagues sent me a promo leaflet which repeatedly mentioned the British Museum and I immediately circulated it through all our social media, mailing list, etc. Turned out it was supposed to be the British Library. Can you dig it?\r\nAlex: Ahahahaha that's hilarious!! I'm speechless\r\nMatt: Well, so am I. Really glad that it's not a paid job actually\r\nAlex: That's a nice silver lining you've got there\r\nMatt: lol But hey, I think I should go back to TWITTER and then jump back to unpaid job number 1. Will I see you soon?\r\nAlex: ok, no worries. Sure, this weekend?\r\nMatt: Yeah, I do think so. Is it rude to suggest we meet at YOURS? I'll bring wine\r\nAlex: ha ha ha Sure, no problem.
