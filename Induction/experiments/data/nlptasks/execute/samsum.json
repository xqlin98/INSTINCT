The characters are strong and likeable too.\r\nNeela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?\r\nClara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here.

It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.\r\nNeela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff.
